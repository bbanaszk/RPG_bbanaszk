## Description 

The design pattern that I plan to implement for this project will likely be the Strategy Behavioral Design Pattern because
this design pattern involves encapsulating algorithms into separate classes so that they are interchangeable.
Specifically, since this is an RPG game and different characters have different attack and defense powers and levels, it 
will enable me to define the main functionality/behaviors that characters have, such as attack and defense mechanisms, and 
allow me to apply different traits to different characters without changing or effecting the main programs' logic.
